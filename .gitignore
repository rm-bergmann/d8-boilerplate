# This file contains default .gitignore rules. To use it, copy it to .gitignore,
# and it will cause files like your settings.php and user-uploaded files to be
# excluded from Git version control. This is a common strategy to avoid
# accidentally including private information in public repositories and patch
# files.
#
# Because .gitignore can be specific to your site, this file has a different
# name; updating Drupal core will not override your custom .gitignore file.

# Ignore core and vendor when managing dependencies with Composer.
web/core
web/vendor
web/modules/contrib
web/themes/contrib

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
# web/sites/*/settings*.php
web/sites/default/services.yml

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.

web/sites/*/private

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.

# DB Backups should live in here

# If you prefer to store your .gitignore file in the sites/ folder, comment
# or delete the previous settings and uncomment the following ones, instead.
